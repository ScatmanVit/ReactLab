React makes sense when you build things with it. This repo is where that happened — for the first time.

Each exercise targets one concept — `useState`, `useEffect`, TypeScript typing — and was written to answer a specific question: *why does this re-render? what actually triggers this effect? when does cleanup matter?*

It's a sincere record of how I started studying the use of React in front-end development, a study that evolved and served as a foundation for building much larger, more complex, and higher-quality projects with React. The main one is LinkMind, available in my repositories.

**useState** — counters, live inputs, dynamic lists, a color picker built two ways to compare approaches.

**useEffect** — a timer synced to the document title, a post list fetched from **JSONPlaceholder**, and a user search by ID with debounce using the same API to avoid unnecessary requests.

**TypeScript** — props, state, and event handlers typed throughout.
